# Behavior Drill Events Challenge

This challenge will allow you to practice event handling and Dom traversal.

You will handle each of the following events:

- [click](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click)
- [mouseover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseover)
- [submit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/submit)
- [keyup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keyup)
- [mouseout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseout)
- [change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change)
- [blur](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/blur)
- [focus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/focus)
- [select](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/select)

There sections in the html that tell you what to do for each event.  Open up the html file in your browser to get started to see what to do.  Start with the click event!

In general for each of the events on the page you will:

- Clone a pre-defined template (at the bottom of the html doc).  Example [here](https://codepen.io/alycit/pen/jarjqy).  The template is already styled for you, you just need to use it.
- Fill it in with the event name and time (HH:MM:SS) and **prepend** it to the div with the `river-content` class.
- Update the count in the top bar for the corresponding event.
- Complete any additional tasks listed in the section for that event.

As you complete all of this work, is there an opportunity to refactor common behaviors into single responsiblity methods?  If so, clean up your code!
